How to create a server :
 To create a server you first have to open "editserver.exe". When you have done that, press
 "Read" button and point to the default "server.exe" file wich follows with Denial zip. The
 editserver will then read all settings of "server.exe" and you are able to config it.

 ( This is how the editserver looks )
 You are allowed to change wich ports the server should open and listen. As default 
 the traffic port (commands) is 2864 and the transfer port (transfer files) is 2865. This
 you are allowed to change to anything. Just make sure so transfer and traffic port aint same port.

 After that you also see a "Startup" choice. This is where you choose how you want your server
 to startup, if you want it else just select "none". The "System.ini" writes a line into "system.ini" at
 windows 9x system, else it writes a shell startup at other systems. Same with the "Win.ini" except
 that it writes a regedit startup on other systems then windows 9x. The regedit startup creates a key
 under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Run" with your choices.

 If you switch tab to "Notifications" you see only two textfields. These are CGI and PHP script urls.
 If you dont know how to use CGI or PHP as script then www.google.com and search for it, im sure
 there is plenty of lessons how to do. Insert your url to the cgi or php if you have any, else just leave it
 blank.

 <img src="ircbot.jpg">

 Switch to "iRC Bot" and its another notification-method. This is a bot for the chatprogram called
 mIRC (www.mirc.com). You are aviable to choose server, bot nickname, channel to join and key for channel.
 If you dont know how to use mirc, then goto mirc.com and there is explainations there. 
 For you who know how to use ircbots, note that this bot does NOT idle in selected channel. It connects,
 join channel, past message with ip and port and then quit to do same thing in 10 min.

 <img src="password.jpg">

 Switching to "Passwords" tab allows you to select a password for server. This password will be
 encrypted inside the server, and noone else will be able to config the server without that password.
 Also noone else can connect to the server without that password.


"So now i have a server, and what do i do now?" you maybe ask.
Well first, if you are a illegal trojaner that loves to crack computers, send the server to some victim, else if you are
a legal network administrator, send over server to your servercomputer that you want to remote control.

Once done that, lets go through all functions and how to use client.

 <img src="Denial1.jpg">

 This is the client where you controll your server. As you see there is two textboxes, one for ip and one for port.
 In these textboxes you type the remote ip and remote port (the port you choosed in editserver). A ip and port
 will be added to the list right under textboxes. If not the status says "Online" just be sure the checkbox is checked
 and that the auto-refreshing is running. The status should soon say "Online" once the server is started. When it does
 you are able to double-click the server-ip in list to open a new client window.
 
 <img src="Denial2.jpg">

 When first open this client window, a box will ask for password IF the server is passworded. Else you will start
 in the "Manager" tab of client. Here you see filemanager, to control the filemanager you first have to get drives.
 Press the "Get Drives" button and the list next to will be filled with all drives EXCEPT A:\. Denial server had a bug
 wich made server crash if no disk was in A:\ and i couldnt get rid of it so i removed it for now. I gonna try to get it
 work on other versions. But not many uses A:\ so its not that bit thing. Anyway, onces the list has been filled with
 drivers, select a driver and press "Refresh". You will then automaticly download a file named "FILES.LST" from server
 wich is encrypted. Client will automaticly decrypt this file and show it into the listview with name size and dir. Then just
 select a file or dir, and press one of the buttons next to, example "Execute". You are also allowed to download and upload
 files to the selected directory, or from the selected directory.

 <img src="Denial3.jpg">

 This is the regeditor wich allows you to browse the remote regedit. A tips is to resize the client window so you see all data
 and values, else it might be a bit boring to work with it. All you have to do for browsing the remote regedit, is choose a regkey to start
 with, example HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Doubleclick that one, and you will automaticly download a file named "REGKEY.LST" and
 "REGVAL.LST" wich contains the encrypted data for all keys and values under selected key. To remove a key select the key in the
 left list (wich has items with a directory-icon) and press "Del Key". To delete a value, select a item in the right list (wich has a icon 
 saying "AB") and press "Del Value". To set a value, select a item in left list and you will see that the itemname appears in one of the
 textboxes. Set the text for the value into the right textbox, the one next to first textbox and press "Set Value". If you want to create a
 new value, just type the new keyname into left textbox, and value into right textbox and press "Set Value". For you who doesnt know
 what registry is in windows, DONT play with this becouse you will probelly just end up with fucking the computer up.

 This is the Process viewer. Here you dont have so much choices. Press the "Refresh" button to get all running processes on remote
 computer, and select a process and press "Kill" to end it. Force end if not windows forbids it ;D

 <img src="Denial5.jpg">

 This is Windows viewer, here you can list all windows, only visibles for now, and hide/show them. Select a window, press hide or show
 or type a caption and press "Chg Caption" . Chg stands för "Change".

 <img src="Denial6.jpg">

 This is where you capture screenshots and webcam-shots from remote computer. I havent got the function to work fully when it comes
 to show the picture, so sometimes when you press "Single Pic" it will download picture, but not show it. If that happends, just press 
 "Single Pic" again, and it should not happen. As you see you have 2 "checkboxes" where you choose if you want
 webcam or screenshot. Under "Quality" you choose how high/low quality you want. You can choose between a
 number between 1-9 where 1 is bad quality but fast transfer, and 9 is good quality and a bit slower transfer. 
 "Save Pic" checkbox allows you to save all income pictures into a dir in same place as exe named "Images".
 "Start" and "Stop" is for looped capturing :D

 <img src="Denial7.jpg">

 This is the transfer queue, here you see all uploads and downloads. You can cancel transfers if that would be needed.

 <img src="Denial8.jpg">

 Under information you are able to grab "own-scripted" reg values and server information. To
 script your own reg-values script, goto "Registry Editor" wich is the tab next to.

 <img src="Denial9.jpg">
 
 Here is my so-called "Script Editor". I will following type a example of a script wich retreives
 computer information for Windows 2k.
 --- START OF SCRIPT ---
 root[hkey_local_machine];
 // This opens the registry root hkey_local_machine
 key[software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion];
 // this opens the following key.

 // this grabs the following values.
 value[CurrentVersion];
 value[RegisteredOwner];
 --- END OF SCRIPT ---

 To grab this info, go back to "Information" tab, and press "Grab info".

 <img src="Denial10.jpg">

 This is the Batch editor, wich allows you to create your own bat and send + execute.
 Noting special with that.

 <img src="Denial11.jpg">

 This is where you change your server information. To read current settings
 press the "Read Settings" button and it will popup. If you want to change anything,
 just write the new settings and press "Save Settings" and it should be changed.

 <img src="Denial12.jpg">

 This is the ircbot section, where you can change and read ircbot settings.

 <img src="Denial13.jpg">

 Change password on server by typing in the current password, then a new one.

 <img src="Denial14.jpg">

 Change the CGI or PHP url if needed. Just put in and press "Set" button.

 <img src="Denial15.jpg">

 Remove, this removes the server from computer. Removes the exefile all startups and just dissapears.
 Dont click this except you are sure you want to remove the server.
