This package include my Delphi virus/worm source collection.  Some of them are
created by me, but most of them are come from other delphi coders. Many Delphi 
coder asked this collection from me earlier...

I am not develop in Delphi about a year  ago, so I decided  to  publish  these 
sources. I think Delphi virus,worm and malware coders will find interest codes 
in this package.

Some of the sources include the compiled binary too.Binaries are compiled with 
D4, D5, D6, D7 and Delphi 2005.  Directory structure  include KAV  (Kaspesrky) 
names. You will find sources which name is Trojan  or Backdoor. I put them  to
this package,  because some AV  detect them  as Backdoor or Trojan but some AV
detect them as worm or virus.

I stop Delphi coding, but it is not mean that i leave the vx-scene ...
